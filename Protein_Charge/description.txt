Positive Proteins
-----------------
This one’s about hunting down the most positively charged proteins in SwissProt. At neutral pH, amino acids D and E count as negative (–1 each), while K, R, and H count as positive (+1 each). So the task is:

Find the top 1000 proteins with the highest positive charge overall.
Find the top 1000 proteins with the highest positive charge relative to molecular weight.

Both results go into FASTA files, and the header should include the protein ID, molecular weight, and charge.

The main rules:
Input = do it in a way it can handle the full SwissProt database (~3 GB).
I only get one pass through the file (so I have to be careful with parsing + storing results efficiently).
Output = two FASTA files with the top proteins by the two criteria.

On another note there are existing tools that calculates MW, pI, amino acid composition, charge at different pH values like ExPASy ProtParam
