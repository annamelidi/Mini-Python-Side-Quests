Mature proteins (signal peptides)
---------------------------------
This one is about digging into UniProt to find human proteins that have a signal peptide. Signal peptides are those short stretches at the beginning of a protein that tell the cell “send me somewhere else” (like secretion). The goal here is:

Find all human proteins (so only entries with Homo sapiens).
From those, keep only the ones with an annotated signal peptide.
Chop off the signal peptide and save the mature part of the protein into a FASTA file.

To determine if there is a signal peptide (which is first in the sequence), then the first FT (feature) line must contain a SIGNAL. The signal is not part of the mature protein, so when you extract the sequence, you must remove the signal.
Sometimes there is a propeptide right after the signal. In such cases the propeptide is not part of the mature protein either and must be removed. Note that a FT feature can span several lines.

FT   SIGNAL        1     20       {ECO:0000255}.
FT   PROPEP       21     82       {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16384863,
FT                                ECO:0000269|PubMed:17185225}.
FT                                /FTId=PRO_0000434044.

-----------------------------------

Tools like SignalP can predict signal peptides, but here I only parse experimentally annotated ones from UniProt.
Biopython (Bio.SeqIO, Bio.SwissProt) → can read SwissProt/UniProt .dat files and extract features like SIGNAL also.
