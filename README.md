# Mini-Python-Side-Quests
Just a bunch of small bioinformatics projects I made during my MSc in Bioinformatics in the Intoduction to Python and Unix course in DTU to get my hands dirty and see what’s really happening behind the scenes of all those fancy library functions. Nothing too fancy—mostly simple implementations of common stuff like graph paths, parsing SwissProt, and other bioinformatics logic.

The idea is to practice coding, try out ideas, have some fun, and maybe get creative. Down the line I might add a web app or visualization on some of them, but for now it’s mostly me poking at algorithms and learning how they tick.
